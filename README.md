## Abstract
This project focusses on imparting advanced image recognition features in security footage to improve real-time alerts and overall safety in banks. In the past, security cameras were used to record footage of everything that goes on in the bank. With the advanced security software, security cameras can send real time alerts to notify emergency services in case of a robbery. The advanced security system recognizes faces of employees and estimates their pose. In case on a robbery, an alarm alert can be sent to the police station by registering a body gesture from the employee.

The main objectives of this project is to recognize faces of bank employees working at the bank, understand body language and sound alarm for a special body gesture and explore various algorithms for face recognition and body pose estimation.

## Introduction
With increasing technology in various aspects of security in banks, security cameras have always been the same. Extensive investigation must be done after a crime in order to gather evidence and leads in finding criminals. With smart vision technology, a lot of time can be saved with proactive alarm systems and criminal information can easily be extracted after the crime. Such security features can make robberies more difficult and can dissuade such crimes in the future.

With high-tech security and low crime rates, people of a community can be safe and have peace of mind. Banks can also be saved from any loss of money. In some countries, security cameras are present extensively. This makes it easier to nab criminals and dissuade people from doing anything immoral and wrong.

The advanced security system recognizes faces of employees and estimates their pose. In case on a robbery, an alarm alert can be sent to the police station by registering a body gesture from the employee. Face recognition is a technique that identifies or locates human faces in digital images. A typical example of face detection occurs when we take photographs through our smartphones, and it instantly detects faces in the picture. Face detection is different from Face recognition. Face detection detects merely the presence of faces in an image while facial recognition involves identifying whose face it is. Face Recognition has many applications in biometrics, surveillance systems, information security and law enforcement.

## Problem Definition
Cameras are present on many public places to improve security and this works fine with motion detectors if it is not necessary to identify the person on the picture automatically. This project focusses on imparting advanced object, face and gesture recognition features in security footage to improve real-time alerts and overall safety in banks. In the past, security cameras were used to record footage of everything that goes on in the bank. With the advanced security software, security cameras can send real time alerts to notify emergency services in case of a robbery. Once a face is detected in images they can be identified or matched with a given face database.
